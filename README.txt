Project 2 - Image Processing

I used only one source to complete this lab, Stack Overflow, to learn how to reference individual RGB values with indexing in order to flip images. I worked with a small team to figure out the swapCorners() function, the team included Devon, Tristan, Sophie, and Nikko.
